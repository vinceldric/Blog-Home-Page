#### Image Processing
- In 500vw, the 500px wide small image will take effect and it will have the original color of the image.
- In 750vw, the 1000px wide medium image will take effect and it will have a darker version of the image.
- In 1250vw, the 2000px wide large image will take effect and it will have a black and white version of the image.

#### Assets

#### Short Summary
<dd>This blog home page is not related to a real company. This blog post is for an assignment requirement but also a possible blog post for a coffee shop. This basically shows people the different types of coffee, what is it made of, and where does it came from. The images posted here changes color when the screen size or viewport widths is being resized.</dd>
